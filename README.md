# Careerra: AI-Powered Mock Interview and Job Readiness Simulation System for IT Jobseekers

## Project Overview
**Program Title:** CAPSTONE PROJECT I  
**Project Title:** Careerra  
**Theme/SDG:** SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 4 (Quality Education)

## Team
- **Principal Investigator:** Jasper Ace Lapitan
- **Co-investigators:** Angel Zoe Mangay-ayam, Rhickwel Valdez
- **Implementing Agency:** LORMA COLLEGES – COLLEGE OF COMPUTER STUDIES AND ENGINEERING

## Rationale
Jobseekers in the Philippines, particularly fresh graduates and first-time applicants, face significant challenges during job interviews despite having academic qualifications. Many struggle with confidence, communication skills, and effectively presenting their technical knowledge due to limited exposure to real interview environments. This project proposes an AI-Powered Mock Interview and Job Readiness Simulation System designed specifically for IT jobseekers.

## Objectives
- Simulate realistic IT job interviews using AI-generated, role-specific questions, including coding challenges.
- Enable voice-based responses, allowing users to answer interview questions verbally.
- Evaluate communication skills, confidence, and technical accuracy, including code logic and explanation.
- Provide automated, actionable feedback and improvement suggestions to guide users.
- Enhance job readiness and employability of fresh graduates and first-time IT jobseekers.
